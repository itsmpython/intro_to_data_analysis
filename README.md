# Introduction to Data Anslysis
A simple introductory coding to start the process of Data Anslysis. Got the source and learning from Udacity course https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170. 
As Udacity says it "You should be really comfortable using Python dictionay, numpy, and pandas after taking this course." 
I am more comfortable using Numpy for sure and getting into Pandas.

## Note
1. daily_engagement.csv has subset of the data for us to start working with.
You can download daily_engagement_full.csv from the Udacity link for full data set.
2. Original name of the file basic_analysis_using_python_l1.ipynb was l1_Starter_Code.ipynb as in Udacity rep
