# Introduction to Data Anslysis
A simple introductory coding to start the process of Data Anslysis. Got the source and learning from Udacity course https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170. 
As Udacity says it "You should be really comfortable using Python dictionay, numpy, and pandas after taking this course." 
I am more comfortable using Numpy for sure and getting into Pandas.
